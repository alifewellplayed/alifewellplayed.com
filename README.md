# A Life Well Played

A Life Well Played is a CMS/Blog project written in Python/Django.

Interested on cloning the site for your own blog, similar or otherwise? Go for it. If you do make something with ALWP or Replica, send me a note, I'd love to see it.

---

## Replica (v2.0.0 in progress)
Replica is a Django content management system I originally wrote for clients who wanted a simple and straight forward solution for posting updates. Since then, I've been slowly expanding and rebuilding it. Specifically, it's a a series of apps bundled tightly together.

### Status
Replica is still being rebuilt, and is currently a work in progress. It's recommended you use at your own risk. You should probably have a good understanding of Django if you want to incorporate this into your project. File and database structure is also still a work in progress, and major migrations may still happen.

### Contribute
The immediate priority is the completion of the dashboard, unit tests and docs, but feel free to send pull requests on bug fixes you might find.

### Support
This software is provided 'as-is'. I can not help you get this working with your project, or offer any kind of support at this moment. If you believe you encountered a bug, open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/jadedgamer/alifewellplayed.com/issues).

### License
Replica is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
